# WP-CLI builds

WP-CLI builds are stored in two places, here and [the releases page](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/releases).

This repo has the latest stable (`phar/wp-cli.phar`) and latest nightly (`phar/wp-cli-nightly.phar`). It also has Debian builds for each release.

The latest nightly represents `HEAD` on the project repo, as built by Travis.
